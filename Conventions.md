* Vertical space is a lovely thing
* HTML/CSS classes prepended with `js-` are for JS, not CSS
* Similarly, HTML/CSS classes prepended with `css-` are, you guessed, only for CSS
* HTML/CSS classes not prefixed with `js-` or `css-` are from Materialize

Javascript
----------

* Member names: `camelCase`
* Private member names: `_camelCase`
* One class per file
* Variable names of HTML elements selected with jquery like must be suffixed with Elem. Example: `const boxWrapElem = $('.box-wrap');`
