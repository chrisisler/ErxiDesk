    Sorting:

        Click on a property title (like 'Process ID') to sort each process by that

        By default, processes should be sorted by memory usage.

    Searching:

        There should exist a magnifying glass icon that, when clicked, displays a
        search bar. In this search bar, users can type in the name of a process,
        and that process should (and any of it's duplicates) should be shown (sorted
        by memory usage first).

    Selection:

        Users should be able to right-click on the process-header -> show a menu
        that allows users to hide certain columns.

    Display:

        Show total number of processes (rows) being displayed.

    Highlighting:

        When hover column title, do smoother transition like when hover a process (row).
