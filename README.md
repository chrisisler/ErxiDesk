# ErxiDesk

ErxiDesk is a desktop GUI for process and file management built with React and Electron.

## Build
- ```npm install```

## Run + Develop
- `sass --watch src/sass` (for sass)
- `npm run dev`
- `npm start`

## Roadmap
- Add button at bottom of processes table to scroll back to top (unless already at top)
- Switch from external sass --watch to node-sass (node-gyp is a big Windows problem?)

### Deadline

I will stop working on ErxiDesk sometime between May 6 and Nov 6 to move forward with other projects.
