# ErxiDesk

ErxiDesk is a Windows desktop GUI for process and file management built with React and Electron.

## Build
- ```npm install```

## Run + Develop
- `sass --watch --no-cache src/sass` (for sass)
- `npm run dev`
- `npm start`

## Roadmap
- ErxiDesk development is finished. This project is done - no longer supported.
- Unfortunately there are Webpack-related problems when trying to make it work on MacOS, so that does not work.
